# PISA Type Test
This Python program provides the context of taking the PISA test using text as well as images that encourage a deductive thinking in order to make the user answer science questions. In this way, the user can choose between different topics:
- Biology, 
- Physics-Chemistry, 
- Geology and 
- Technology, 
and answer the corresponding questions as part of an attempt, after which the user will get a `.txt` file with their results.

Also, there is a special section about general culture which shows up once the user has gone through the whole program.
